Mawal Coding Specification using Aseel Language

* Centralized Core for Project Operations
* Ensure Patternized Data and Attributes
* Modular Build-up for All Project Requirements
* Use as Few Files as Possible

1. Introduction
   The Mawal Coding Specification is built on the Aseel Language, which defines a structured framework for developing Machine Learning Ready Systems using the pattern:
   . → I → O → A → H

This pattern represents the natural evolution of intelligence — from raw input to interconnected understanding. Each stage defines how data, code, and knowledge should evolve and interact across the system.

. (dot): Raw Input or Data Source
This is the initial state — the starting point where data is unstructured or unlabeled, such as text, images, audio, or logs.
It represents the first byte from the user’s end that triggers all subsequent operations, or the underlying reason why data is structured in a specific way.
For example, the Egyptian ID number embeds the date of birth within its structure — a design that allows the ID itself to memorize part of the information it represents.

I: Feature Definition
At this stage, raw data becomes meaningful. It is labeled, categorized, and transformed into features that represent essential characteristics.
In code, this step defines the type, identity, and purpose of each element within the system.

O: Program Module Core
Here, structure and relationships emerge.
Modules are organized based on system needs and the targeted user segment (A Class, B Class, or C Class).
Relationships between features and their logical connections are clearly defined, ensuring that every module serves a coherent purpose within the larger system.

A: Application Model
This stage represents action and operation.
The system’s models, workflows, or functions are trained, validated, and tested — transforming from structured potential into working intelligence.
The program becomes active and begins to interact dynamically with users and data.

H: Product Unit
This identifies the final, deployable unit within the project.
It is the stage of integration — where all parts come together into a functional and configurable product.
Each unit can be adapted, evolved, or extended according to future requirements without breaking the overall system.

2. Build Options

CA: Class A Users Specification

* Prioritize high-quality usability and refined user experience
* Extensive use of animation, motion, and advanced UX behavior
* Visual and functional excellence for premium audiences

CB: Class B Users Specification

* Balanced approach between quality and usability
* Practical design with efficient performance and maintainable structure
* Balanced ML optimization for cost and experience

CC: Class C Users Specification

* Focus on usability first with minimal visual design requirements
* Lightweight performance with simplified structure
* Prioritize accessibility and system efficiency

3- File Naming
- name all core files to core.x, and final singel file projects as app.x
- databse and tables all lowercase and use only '_' for spacing

4- App Packager
- Create a bash script to package the whol app in a single file app.x
- it will have all project files in the header
- it will minize all the files, combine it and update the links and routs
